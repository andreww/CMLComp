About CMLComp
-------------

CML is the Chemical Markup Language.

CMLComp is a dialect of CML - a subset, or profile, 
with more strongly defined syntax and semantics.

CMLComp consists of microformats, which encode 
commonly-used data idioms, and a document structure 
which provides human-accessible information.

For more documentation, please browse the CMLComp wiki.
