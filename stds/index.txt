CMLComp: CML for Computational Atomistics
=========================================

NOTE: This document has been recovered and
transcribed from the internet archive. It 
was originally written by Toby White and 
other members of the eMinerals and Materials
Grid teams. Not all links work and not all
material has been located but hopefully this
document will be useful to people intrested in 
CML for computational atomic scale simulation.
Further material can be found 
link:../index.html[here].

CMLComp is designed to address the issue 
of information exchange in the area of 
computational atomistics, or molecular-scale 
simulation.

About CMLComp
-------------

CML is the Chemical Markup Language.

CMLComp is a dialect of CML - a subset, or profile, 
with more link:./FormalStandards.html[strongly defined 
syntax and semantics].

CMLComp consists of microformats, which encode 
commonly-used data idioms, and a 
link:./DocumentStructure.html[document structure]
which provides human-accessible information.

For more documentation, please browse the CMLComp wiki.
