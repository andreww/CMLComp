CMLComp Standardization
=======================

NOTE: This document has been recovered and
transcribed from the internet archive. It 
was originally written by Toby White and 
other members of the eMinerals and Materials
Grid teams. Not all links work and not all
material has been located but hopefully this
document will be useful to people intrested in 
CML for computational atomic scale simulation.
Further material can be found 
link:../index.html[here].

CML standards
-------------

link:http://www.xml-cml.org[CML] is currently formally 
described only by a WXS (W3C XML Schema) Schema. It is 
not intended that CML's syntax and semantics are entirely 
defined by this schema, but in the absence of a more 
complete schema language, no other formal schemata are 
available.

CMLComp standards
-----------------

CMLComp is a subset of CML which has three primary layers:

* Microformats for useful information: link:./CmlMicroformats.html[CmlMicroformats]
* A document structure: link:./DocumentStructure.html[DocumentStructure]
* A lightweight semantic mechanism, organized around the 
principle of dictionary references: link:/.DictRefs.html[DictRefs]

A description of the background to and interplay between 
these layers is available in this paper (unpublished, 
in submission).

The syntax of the first two components, microformats and 
document structure, can be expressed quite aptly in a 
mixture of Relax-NG and Schematron (commonly called 
Relaxotron).

The development of this schema is still underway. Recent 
versions are available from the git repository at 
http://www.uszla.me.uk/git/CMLComp.git (view online 
at http://uszla.me.uk/gitweb/CMLComp.git).

CMLComp conformance levels
--------------------------

There are two levels of conformance for CompCML; microformat 
conformance and document structure conformance.

It is important to note that neither of these conformance 
levels are affected by the use of XML languages other than 
CML - microformats may be inserted into a non-CML document, 
and it still be conformant, and equally, non-CML elements may 
be used (in certain places) within a correctly structured 
CML document, and it still be conformant.

Furthermore, note that CMLComp defines the syntax and semantics 
of only a small portion of the full CML language. Where CML 
elements are used whose behaviour is not defined by CMLComp, 
conformance levels are not affected - that is to say that you 
may use additional CML elements within 
your CMLComp documents.

For information on how to use a schema validator to check 
conformance, see link:./ConformanceCheckers.html[ConformanceCheckers]

CMLComp-micro
-------------

CMLComp-micro conformance guarantees that all CMLComp 
microstructures used within a document are syntactically 
correct according to CompCML strictures. This enables 
CMLComp microformats to be embedded within any XML file; 
for example within an XHTML document, or a CML document 
format of your own devising.

If a document conforms to CMLComp-micro, then information 
can be extracted and machine processed by CMLComp-aware 
tools.

To check microformat conformance, run your document through 
a schema checker against this schema.

For further details on what microformats are governed by 
CMLComp, and their definition, see link:./CmlMicroformats.html[CmlMicroformats].

CMLComp-doc
-----------

CMLComp-doc conformance guarantees not only that all CMLComp 
microstructures used in a document are correct, but also that 
the document is structured according to the conventions of 
CMLComp.

Conformance to this level allows document-level viewing tools 
to be used, as well as more powerful analysis programs. It 
also enables human comprehension of your documents by conforming 
to commonly understood conventions.

To check document-level conformance, run your document through 
a schema checker against this schema.

link:./DocumentStructure.html[DocumentStructure].
