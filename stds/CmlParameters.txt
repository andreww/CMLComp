Representing and identifying input quantities in CMLComp
========================================================

Parameters is a title for data within CMLComp which is 
specified as input in the course of a computational 
workflow. For example, this might be the initial 
temperature or pressure of a molecular 
dynamics run. (Note that this specification very 
closely parallels that of CmlProperties).

Parameters are written in CML by encoding the relevant 
quantity using the microformats shown in CmlData, and 
then wrapping that with a <parameter> tag, carrying 
certain attributes which describe the property.

There SHOULD be a dictRef attribute (see CmlDictRefs?) 
which points to a dictionary entry describing (either 
in human- or machine-readable fashion) the context and 
meaning of the parameter in question. This MUST be a 
QName, and the relevant namespace prefix MUST be declared. 
(However, there is no requirement that the dictionary 
referred to be accessible, or even exist.)

There MAY be a title attribute which is a short title, 
intended only for human consumption, describing this 
quantity. This alone will not be sufficient for full 
disambiguation, but might be used for eg displaying a 
title for the quantity in a visualization program. This 
may be any string, and CMLComp places no rules on its 
interpretation.

There MAY be an id attribute, which must be an XML Name. 
(See CmlIdRef? for further information on the meaning 
and use of id/ref attributes.)

CMLComp puts no further restrictions on any attributes 
(in any, or no namespace) which may be put on 
a <parameter> tag. 

Thus, for example:

----
<parameter title="Initial temperature" dictRef="dlpoly:Tinit">
  <scalar dataType="fpx:real" units="dlpolyUnits:K"> 298.15 </scalar>
</property>
----

defines the initial temperature of a DL_Poly molecular dynamics
run.
