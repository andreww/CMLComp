CmlMicroformats
===============


NOTE: This document has been recovered and
transcribed from the internet archive. It 
was originally written by Toby White and 
other members of the eMinerals and Materials
Grid teams. Not all links work and not all
material has been located but hopefully this
document will be useful to people intrested in 
CML for computational atomic scale simulation.
Further material can be found 
link:../index.html[here].

CMLComp is built from a series of components, 
represented by microformats in the CML 
language.

The currently-used ones are defined in the 
schema: http://uszla.me.uk/gitweb/CMLComp.git/master:/Microformats.rnc

To validate a document against Microformats (which 
is to say - a document may contain any amount of 
any XML dialect, but if it uses CMLComp microformats, 
it uses them correctly), then it must validate 
against http://uszla.me.uk/gitweb/CMLComp.git/master:/CMLMicro.rnc 
(see http://cmlcomp.org/validator/)

This page holds the documentation for these microformats.

In short, these consist of

* scalar/array/matrix combinations of character, 
logical, integer, real, and complex data. 
See link:./CmlData.html[CmlData]. 

[NOTE]
The representation of numerical data presents 
particular problems in XML - see link:./FloatingPointXml.html[FloatingPointXml].

* metadata - in simple name/value pairs, no controlled 
vocabulary, and lists of metadata. See 
link:./CmlMetadata.html[CmlMetadata]

* parameters - which are essentially input quantities, 
and lists of parameters. See link:./CmlParameters.html[CmlParameters]

* properties - which are essentially output, calculated, 
quantities - and lists of properties. See 
link:./CmlProperties.html[CmlProperties]

* molecules - which are a set of 3-D atomic coordinates, with 
at least a label for each atom. See link:./CmlMolecules.html[CmlMolecules] 

* lattices - defining a crystal lattice by means of three 
lattice vectors. See link:./CmlLattices.html[CmlLattices]

* crystals - defining a crystal lattice by means of three 
lengths and three angles. See link:./CmlCrystals.html[CmlCrystals]
