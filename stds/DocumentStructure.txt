CMLComp consiste of CmlMicroformats which are 
strung together in a document - the structure 
of this document is well-defined, in order to 
allow the retrieval of information easily.

The document structure is described in the 
schema in http://www.uszla.me.uk/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=CMLComp.git;a=blob_plain;f=DocumentStructure.rnc
and is documented here.

There are several aspects to this document 
structure, which are being addressed one by one.

From the point of view of how structures and unit 
cells are related within a series of modules
